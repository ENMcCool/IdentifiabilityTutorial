# IdentifiabilityTutorial

This repository contains several Jupyter notebooks with Julia code that are associated with "Parameter identifiability, parameter estimation and model prediction for differential equation models" by Matthew J Simpson and Ruth E Baker.  

These worksheets are to be presented at the 2024 SIAM Life Sciences Conference in Portland, Oregon.  A write-up of the results are available on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08177
